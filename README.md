# Audio Command Recognition System

This project implements an **Audio Command Recognition System** using MATLAB and deep learning. The system records an audio command, processes it, and classifies it into predefined categories. It uses a trained neural network model to make predictions and displays the predicted class with its probability.

## Features

- **Audio Command Recognition**: Recognizes voice commands from recorded audio.
- **Real-time Recording**: Records audio through the microphone.
- **Live Playback**: Plays back the recorded audio after it is captured.
- **Prediction**: Classifies the audio command using a deep learning model.
- **Display of Prediction**: Shows the predicted command and the corresponding probability.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

- **MATLAB** (Version 2019 or later)
- **Deep Learning Toolbox** (for training and using neural networks)
- **Audio Toolbox** (for audio processing)
- **Pretrained Neural Network Model** (Trained model file for classification)
- **Support Packages** (for microphone access, sound playback, etc.)

## Setup

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audio-command-recognition.git
   ```
````

2. **Install required packages**:
   Make sure you have the necessary MATLAB toolboxes installed (e.g., Deep Learning Toolbox, Audio Toolbox). You can install them using the MATLAB Add-On Explorer.

3. **Prepare the trained model**:

   - The neural network model for classification should be trained using a dataset of audio commands.
   - Place the trained model file (`trainedNet.mat` or equivalent) in the project directory.

4. **Preprocessing audio data**:
   - The audio data should be recorded with a consistent sample rate and duration.
   - Audio preprocessing (such as feature extraction, normalization, etc.) should be handled before passing the data into the trained network.

## Usage

1. **Run the main script**:
   The script `audio_command_recognition.m` handles the full process of recording, processing, and classifying the audio command.

   - The system will record a 2-second audio sample.
   - It will then preprocess the audio and pass it to the trained neural network for classification.
   - The predicted class with its probability will be displayed in the MATLAB console.
   - The recorded audio will also be played back.

2. **Testing the system**:
   To test the system with your own audio commands, ensure that you have a trained model and modify the script as needed to match the input format.

## Example Output

```bash
Recording...
Recording complete.
Playing back recorded audio...
Predicted Command: 'TOL3'
Probability: 85.62%
Prediction Scores for All Classes:
L1: 5.23%
TOL2: 0.74%
TOL3: 85.62%
TOL4: 3.21%
TOFL1: 1.11%
TOFL2: 0.92%
TOFL3: 1.05%
TOFL4: 2.12%
```

## Model Training

To train your own model:

1. Prepare a dataset of labeled audio commands.
2. Extract features from the audio data (e.g., Mel-spectrogram, MFCCs).
3. Train a neural network using `trainNetwork` with your data.
